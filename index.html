          Due to the current Covid-19 situation we have now made the decision to move this years Månegarm Open Air to 26-27 of August 2022.
          <br>
          Many of us have hoped, and still hope, that it will be possible to arrange festivals again, for real, in 2021, but at the time of writing it does not look like that in Sweden unfortunately. Even though things are looking better, which is great ofcourse, we can't say what is possible to arrange in august. We want you to know this in time and not the last minute and we also do not want to arrange a festival with many restrictions.
          <br>
          We want to relive the 2019 success with visitors from over 30 countries and a fantastic atmosphere, we want fellowship and hugs, we want head-banging in front of the stage and we want the best METAL weekend ever!! With probable travel restrictions and restrictions at site, this would not be possible and the feeling of community and "real" festival would not be the same at all. We have been in contact with the bands and all of them have already agreed to play at next years festival. Info on how to proceed with your purchased tickets will be coming soon.
          <br>
          So save the date brothers & sisters; The 26-27 of august 2022 we'll rock n' roll like never before!!
